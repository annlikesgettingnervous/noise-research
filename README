noise-research

Research on sounds for healing & putting mind in operation (more active or more relax) for what one has to do next (relaxation, meditation, hard mind work, etc). And of course methods to produce them.

This first sample is my first production, aimed at freeing the mind from thoughts in preparation to meditation. It is a one hour track, so it is alright for everyone even first meditation comers.

It is built with socks and some other treatment I will push next.

Feel comfortable to test and feed me back with your remark, critics, suggestions.
